Extracting numerical properties from output files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Quantum packages simulations generate output file in different formats. For examples the SCM_ simulation suite
(``ADF`` and ``DFTB`` in *QMWorks*) generate binary outputs, while other packages like ``CP2K``, ``Gamess-US`` and ``Orca``
generate ascii text files.  Some other packages like ``Dirac`` generate a structure text output like *XML*.

*QMWorks* abstract away all the different commmunication protocols with the different output formats, allowing the user to
extract the desire property by using the convention::

  result = job.property

where job is the simulation perform with a given package and property is the numerical value of interest (scalar or array).


The  *QMWorks* implementation of the aforemention mechanism search in the JSON  files located at ``qmworks/data/dictionaries/``
for instructions about how to read that given property from the output file. Nevertheless, *Not all the properties for a given
pacakge are implemented*. **If the property of your interest is not available you can request it in the QMWorks issues page**.


Parsers
~~~~~~~
Internally *QMWorks* uses different mechanism to extract different properties from the output files. In the case of the ``ADF`` and
``DFTB`` packages, *QMWorks* take advantages of the python interface to kftools_ files developed by the SCM_. In the case of *XML* output,
*QMWorks* direcltly uses the python built-in xml_ reader. For the output files in text format *QMWorks* uses a mixuture of awk_ and
*parsers*.

Parsers are a robust alternative to regular expressions, parsers are modular and reusable, while
|regex| tends to be abstruse and difficult to reuse. A parser is a function that decomposes a string (or binary) into its syntactic components using some predefined rules or grammar. 
The library  pyparsing_ offers all the functionality to parse strings, some detail explanation about the library can be found at docs_.
