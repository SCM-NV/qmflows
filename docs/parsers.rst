Parsers
=======
Parser are a robust alternative to regular expressions, parsers are modular and reusable, while
|regex| tends to be abstruse and difficult to reuse. A parser is a function that decomposes a string (or binary) into its syntactic components using some predefined rules or grammar. 
The library  pyparsing_ offers all the functionality to parse strings, some detail explanation about the library can be found at docs_.
