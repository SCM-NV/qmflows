HDF5_ is a data model to store and represent complex numerical data in a hierarchical way.
HDF5_ is extremely optimized to perform fast I/O operations in large data set and it is
implemented as a library with APIs to Python, C, C++, etc. The python interface is called
pyh5_ and it was designed to run along with Numpy as Scipy. 

To store numerical result in using pyh5_, there is a class :class:`~StoreasHDF5`
