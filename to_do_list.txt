    export the results back into a .pdb file

bond orders can get messed up upon converting between plams and rdkit molecules

cis/trans information is lost upon converting between plams and rdkit molecules

automatically set formal atomic charges in prepare_pdb() depending on the element and the total molecular charge
    plams atom properties?

ligand name: ligand molecular formula
    need a more unique ligand name
